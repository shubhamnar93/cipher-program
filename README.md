This is a Caesar Cipher program created as part of the 100 Days of Python course by Angela Yu. The program allows users to encrypt or decrypt messages by shifting letters in the alphabet by a specified number of positions. It's a basic introduction to encryption techniques and demonstrates the use of loops and string manipulation in Python.
this code performs:
1. Encryption: Shifts the letters of a message forward in the alphabet by a specified amount.
2. Decryption: Reverses the shift to restore the original message.
3. Supports Custom Shift Values: The user can choose how many positions to shift the letters.
4. Handles Wraparound: Automatically wraps letters around the alphabet (e.g., shifting 'z' forward gives 'a').
5. Case Insensitive: Works with both uppercase and lowercase letters.
6. Simple Text-Based Interface: Easy to input and view results in the terminal.
